# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project scaffold (build prompt B0): `src/mcp_server_sapbw` package tree (core, repositories,
  services, connectors, models, prompts), `server.py` entry-point stub, and offline test scaffold.
- `pyproject.toml` with pinned `fastmcp==3.4.4`, `hdbcli`, `pydantic`, `pyyaml`, optional `rfc`
  extra, and ruff / mypy (strict) / pytest / coverage configuration.
- `.gitignore` hardening, `profiles.example.yaml`, `.env.example`.
- Documentation: README skeleton, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, this changelog.
- Licensed under Apache-2.0.
- GitHub Actions CI: ruff, mypy, pytest (offline), secret scanning, and a customer-object
  leak check.

### Notes
- No BW logic yet. The core layer lands in B1; live capability discovery (B2) is a hard gate before
  any repository or tool code.
